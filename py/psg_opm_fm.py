"""Declarative PSG square-tone projection using OPM FM and feedback.

The two-operator AL4/FB7 profile is compatible with the published vgm-conv
mapping parameters. This module contains independently written target rules;
no external converter code is incorporated or required at runtime.
The voice parameters and volume-to-TL table reference vgm-conv's AY8910-to-OPM
converter. Attribution and its ISC license are retained in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
