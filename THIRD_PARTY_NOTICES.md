This file records referenced material and the direct external tools used by this

## vgm-conv

Project: [digital-sound-antiques/vgm-conv](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/vgm-conv)

Reference revision: `780a20ed505e23eb21aa9c6ce3f349029718b5a0`

Reference source:
[src/converter/ay8910-to-opm-coverter.ts](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/vgm-conv/blob/780a20ed505e23eb21aa9c6ce3f349029718b5a0/src/converter/ay8910-to-opm-coverter.ts)

The PSG FM projection in `py/psg_opm_fm.py` uses the published AY8910-to-OPM
voice parameters and volume-to-TL mapping as a reference. This includes
AL4/FB7, the MUL2/TL27 modulator, MUL1 carrier, fixed-level TL table and eight
attenuation steps of headroom. Segment processing and target generation are
implemented in this project; the external converter is not a runtime dependency.
The upstream notice is retained for these referenced mapping materials.

## mmlx 0.2.0

Project: [h1romas4/chipstream](https://github.com/h1romas4/chipstream)

Use: MML-to-MDX compilation and the FM part of the typed PCM backend. This crate is linked into the Rust
`mdx-fixture-generator` helper; it is not a separate command-line subprocess.
The exact Cargo version is pinned in `scripts/mdx_fixture_generator/Cargo.toml`.
The published package's `.cargo_vcs_info.json` records revision `7e0c97733d3636e40ee23233c898e74691d48417`.

License: MIT. The following text is copied from the installed published crate's
[LICENSE](https://github.com/h1romas4/chipstream/blob/7e0c97733d3636e40ee23233c898e74691d48417/crates/mmlx/LICENSE).

## soundlog 0.15.0

Project: [h1romas4/chipstream](https://github.com/h1romas4/chipstream)

Use: MDX-to-VGM replay, PDX construction and PCM reference checks. This crate is linked into the Rust
`mdx-fixture-generator` helper; it is not a separate command-line subprocess.
The exact Cargo version is pinned in `scripts/mdx_fixture_generator/Cargo.toml`.

## MXC v1.01

Authors: MFS soft, milk. The compiler banner reads:

```text
MML converter for mxdrv2  version 1.01 (c)1989 MFS soft, milk.
```

Use: external Human68k MML-to-MDX compiler executed through run68x.
The setup script extracts `mxc.x` and its accompanying `mxc.doc` from
[MDX_TOOL.lzh](https://nfggames.com/x68000/Mirrors/x68pub/x68tools/SOUND/MXDRV/MDX_TOOL.lzh).
The checked archive SHA-256 is
`4d4a6f00a100c728f5f4b217998e66ca8e6fa530cdfe1a5ee7c03f70715d98c4`;
`mxc.x` SHA-256 is
`38def25dae39ae35a16668f086843ae9f0d00295e50fd034b7b4108f7c762086`.

The original CP932 `mxc.doc` states:

```text
☆ このプログラムはフリーウェアです。配布はご自由にどうぞ。
```

This permits distribution of MXC as freeware. It is not an MIT, ISC or GPL
license, and the checked documentation does not establish permission to modify
MXC or access its source. Keep `mxc.doc` with the compiler if redistributing it.
This permission concerns MXC itself: it is not a blanket license for the other
programs bundled in the historical archive. The archive's `readme.doc` describes
an unofficial repack; setup only extracts MXC and its document.

## run68x

Project: [kg68k/run68x](https://github.com/kg68k/run68x)

Installed revision: `fc28826dd795b1f0a3241f0b03fe2353e12e7233`

Use: a separately executed Human68k runner for MXC, locally fetched and built.
Its code is not linked into the Python converter or the Rust helper.

License: GNU GPL version 2 or later, as stated by the pinned
[README](https://github.com/kg68k/run68x/blob/fc28826dd795b1f0a3241f0b03fe2353e12e7233/README.md)
and source headers. Author: TcbnErik, with upstream run68 contributors.
For example, `src/run68.c` carries `Copyright (C) 2025 TcbnErik`.
Other files retain their respective upstream notices, including the separately
licensed Windows console component; this example is not an exhaustive copyright list.

The full license is preserved in the fetched checkout's
[LICENCE](https://github.com/kg68k/run68x/blob/fc28826dd795b1f0a3241f0b03fe2353e12e7233/LICENCE).
When redistributing run68x, retain its copyright/license notices and comply with
GPL source-distribution requirements (in particular section 3 for binaries).
A README credit alone does not replace those requirements.

## Optional mdxtools inspectors

Project: [vampirefrog/mdxtools](https://github.com/vampirefrog/mdxtools)

Installed revision: `9c8539fec2757fcf7c85d1986171b50ebe2ef1e5`

Use: independent `mdxinfo`, `pdxinfo`, `mdxdump` and `mdx2mml` commands installed
only by `scripts/setup_tools.sh --with-mdxtools`.
The upstream README refers to its
[LICENSE](https://github.com/vampirefrog/mdxtools/blob/9c8539fec2757fcf7c85d1986171b50ebe2ef1e5/LICENSE),
which contains GNU GPL version 3. Preserve the upstream checkout, component
notices and corresponding source if redistributing these tools; this entry is
not a full audit of mdxtools' bundled sources and submodules.

## Distribution scope

The repository and listening exports do not bundle the above external compiler,
runner or inspector executables. The setup script retains MXC's document and
full Git checkouts for run68x/mdxtools. Cargo fetches the published Rust crates,
whose license files were checked for the notices above.

A distribution of the Rust helper binary must also cover its transitive
Rust dependencies from `Cargo.lock`; the two direct MIT notices above are not
an exhaustive binary-distribution license bundle. The inspected lockfile
contains permissive MIT/Apache-2.0 alternatives and, for `unicode-ident`, an
additional Unicode-3.0 requirement. Preserve applicable upstream license and
copyright texts before distributing such a binary.
